# CLAUDE.md - Recovery Module

## Overview

`digital.vasic.recovery` is a generic, reusable Go module for application-level fault tolerance. It provides named circuit breakers, periodic health checking, and a unified resilience facade.

**Module**: `digital.vasic.recovery` (Go 1.24+)
**Depends on**: `digital.vasic.concurrency`

## Build & Test

```bash
go build ./...
go test ./... -count=1 -race
go test ./... -short              # Unit tests only
go test -bench=. ./...            # Benchmarks
```

## Code Style

- Standard Go conventions, `gofmt` formatting
- Imports grouped: stdlib, third-party, internal (blank line separated)
- Line length <= 100 chars
- Naming: `camelCase` private, `PascalCase` exported, acronyms all-caps
- Errors: always check, wrap with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`
- Tests: table-driven, `testify`, naming `Test<Struct>_<Method>_<Scenario>`

## Package Structure

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pkg/breaker` | Named circuit breaker with logging, callbacks, statistics, and registry |
| `pkg/health` | Periodic health checker with configurable interval and status tracking |
| `pkg/facade` | Unified resilience API composing breakers and health checkers |

## Key Interfaces

- `Logger` (in breaker and health) -- Structured logging (Info, Warn, Debug)
- `CheckFunc` -- Health probe function returning nil (healthy) or error
- `CircuitBreaker` -- Execute, GetState, GetStats, Reset, SetStateChangeCallback
- `Resilience` -- Facade: GetOrCreateBreaker, AddHealthCheck, Execute, Stats, Stop

## Design Patterns

- **Decorator**: CircuitBreaker wraps concurrency breaker with logging, callbacks, stats
- **Registry**: CircuitBreakerManager maintains named breakers with GetOrCreate
- **Observer**: State-change callbacks and health status transitions
- **Facade**: Resilience unifies breaker management and health checking

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** use `su` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Container-Based Solutions
When a build or runtime environment requires system-level dependencies, use containers instead of elevation:

- **Use the `Containers` submodule** (`https://github.com/vasic-digital/Containers`) for containerized build and runtime environments
- **Add the `Containers` submodule as a Git dependency** and configure it for local use within the project
- **Build and run inside containers** to avoid any need for privilege escalation
- **Rootless Podman/Docker** is the preferred container runtime

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo` or `su`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Use the `Containers` submodule for containerized builds
5. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**
