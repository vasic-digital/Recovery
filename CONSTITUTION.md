# CONSTITUTION — Recovery

Project-specific governance for the **Recovery** repository. This document carries the Universal Mandatory Constraints inherited from the cross-project root.


## Universal Mandatory Constraints

These rules are inherited from the cross-project Universal Mandatory Development Constraints (canonical source: `/tmp/UNIVERSAL_MANDATORY_RULES.md`, derived from the HelixAgent root `CLAUDE.md`). They are non-negotiable across every project, submodule, and sibling repository. Project-specific addenda are welcome but cannot weaken or override these.

### Hard Stops (permanent, non-negotiable)

1. **NO CI/CD pipelines.** No `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.travis.yml`, `.circleci/`, or any automated pipeline. No Git hooks either. All builds and tests run manually or via Makefile / script targets.
2. **NO HTTPS for Git.** SSH URLs only (`git@github.com:…`, `git@gitlab.com:…`, etc.) for clones, fetches, pushes, and submodule operations. Including for public repos. SSH keys are configured on every service.
3. **NO manual container commands.** Container orchestration is owned by the project's binary / orchestrator (e.g. `make build` → `./bin/<app>`). Direct `docker`/`podman start|stop|rm` and `docker-compose up|down` are prohibited as workflows. The orchestrator reads its configured `.env` and brings up everything.

### Mandatory Development Standards

1. **100% Test Coverage.** Every component MUST have unit, integration, E2E, automation, security/penetration, and benchmark tests. No false positives. Mocks/stubs ONLY in unit tests; all other test types use real data and live services.
2. **Challenge Coverage.** Every component MUST have Challenge scripts (`./challenges/scripts/`) validating real-life use cases. No false success — validate actual behavior, not return codes.
3. **Real Data.** Beyond unit tests, all components MUST use actual API calls, real databases, live services. No simulated success. Fallback chains tested with actual failures.
4. **Health & Observability.** Every service MUST expose health endpoints. Circuit breakers for all external dependencies. Prometheus / OpenTelemetry integration where applicable.
5. **Documentation & Quality.** Update `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and relevant docs alongside code changes. Pass language-appropriate format/lint/security gates. Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.
6. **Validation Before Release.** Pass the project's full validation suite (`make ci-validate-all`-equivalent) plus all challenges (`./challenges/scripts/run_all_challenges.sh`).
7. **No Mocks or Stubs in Production.** Mocks, stubs, fakes, placeholder classes, TODO implementations are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in production code. All production code is fully functional with real integrations. Only unit tests may use mocks/stubs.
8. **Comprehensive Verification.** Every fix MUST be verified from all angles: runtime testing (actual HTTP requests / real CLI invocations), compile verification, code structure checks, dependency existence checks, backward compatibility, and no false positives in tests or challenges. Grep-only validation is NEVER sufficient.
9. **Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges (CRITICAL).** ALL test and challenge execution MUST be strictly limited to 30-40% of host system resources. Use `GOMAXPROCS=2`, `nice -n 19`, `ionice -c 3`, `-p 1` for `go test`. Container limits required. The host runs mission-critical processes — exceeding limits causes system crashes.
10. **Bugfix Documentation.** All bug fixes MUST be documented in `docs/issues/fixed/BUGFIXES.md` (or the project's equivalent) with root cause analysis, affected files, fix description, and a link to the verification test/challenge.
11. **Real Infrastructure for All Non-Unit Tests.** Mocks/fakes/stubs/placeholders MAY be used ONLY in unit tests (files ending `_test.go` run under `go test -short`, equivalent for other languages). ALL other test types — integration, E2E, functional, security, stress, chaos, challenge, benchmark, runtime verification — MUST execute against the REAL running system with REAL containers, REAL databases, REAL services, and REAL HTTP calls. Non-unit tests that cannot connect to real services MUST skip (not fail).
12. **Reproduction-Before-Fix (CONST-032 — MANDATORY).** Every reported error, defect, or unexpected behavior MUST be reproduced by a Challenge script BEFORE any fix is attempted. Sequence: (1) Write the Challenge first. (2) Run it; confirm fail (it reproduces the bug). (3) Then write the fix. (4) Re-run; confirm pass. (5) Commit Challenge + fix together. The Challenge becomes the regression guard for that bug forever.
13. **Concurrent-Safe Containers (Go-specific, where applicable).** Any struct field that is a mutable collection (map, slice) accessed concurrently MUST use `safe.Store[K,V]` / `safe.Slice[T]` from `digital.vasic.concurrency/pkg/safe` (or the project's equivalent primitives). Bare `sync.Mutex + map/slice` combinations are prohibited for new code.

### Definition of Done (universal)

A change is NOT done because code compiles and tests pass. "Done" requires pasted terminal output from a real run, produced in the same session as the change.

- **No self-certification.** Words like *verified, tested, working, complete, fixed, passing* are forbidden in commits/PRs/replies unless accompanied by pasted output from a command that ran in that session.
- **Demo before code.** Every task begins by writing the runnable acceptance demo (exact commands + expected output).
- **Real system, every time.** Demos run against real artifacts.
- **Skips are loud.** `t.Skip` / `@Ignore` / `xit` / `describe.skip` without a trailing `SKIP-OK: #<ticket>` comment break validation.
- **Evidence in the PR.** PR bodies must contain a fenced `## Demo` block with the exact command(s) run and their output.

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

### CONST-033 — Host Power Management is Forbidden

**Status:** Mandatory. Non-negotiable. Applies to every project,
submodule, container entry point, build script, test, challenge, and
systemd unit shipped from this repository.

**Rule:** No code in this repository may invoke a host-level power-
state transition (suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-
hibernate, poweroff, halt, reboot, kexec) on the host machine. This
includes — but is not limited to:

- `systemctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}`
- `loginctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}`
- `pm-{suspend,hibernate,suspend-hybrid}`
- `shutdown {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to any value other than `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

**Why:** The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI-agent and
container workloads. On 2026-04-26 18:23:43 the host was auto-
suspended by the GDM greeter's idle policy mid-session, killing
HelixAgent and 41 dependent services. Recurring memory-pressure
SIGKILLs of `user@1000.service` (perceived as "logged out") have the
same outcome. Auto-suspend, hibernate, and any power-state transition
are unsafe for this host.

**Defence in depth (mandatory artifacts in every project):**
1. `scripts/host-power-management/install-host-suspend-guard.sh` —
   privileged installer, manual prereq, run once per host with sudo.
   Masks `sleep.target`, `suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`,
   `hybrid-sleep.target`; writes `AllowSuspend=no` drop-in; sets
   logind `IdleAction=ignore` and `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`.
2. `scripts/host-power-management/user_session_no_suspend_bootstrap.sh` —
   per-user, no-sudo defensive layer. Idempotent. Safe to source from
   `start.sh` / `setup.sh` / `bootstrap.sh`.
3. `scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` —
   static scanner. Exits non-zero on any forbidden invocation.
4. `challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` — asserts
   the running host's state matches layer-1 masking.
5. `challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` — wraps the
   scanner as a challenge that runs in CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Enforcement:** Every project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`
equivalent MUST run both challenges (host state + source tree). A
violation in either channel blocks merge. Adding files to the
scanner's `EXCLUDE_PATHS` requires an explicit justification comment
identifying the non-host context.

**See also:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` for full background and
runbook.

## Sixth Law — Real User Verification (Anti-Pseudo-Test Rule)

> Inherits from the root project's Anti-Bluff Testing Pact and the cross-project
> universal mandate (CONST-035). Submodule rules below are additive, never
> relaxing.

A test that passes while the feature it covers is broken for end users is the
most expensive kind of test in this codebase — it converts unknown breakage into
believed safety. This has happened in consuming projects before: tests and
Integration Challenge Tests executed green while large parts of the product
were unusable on a real device. That outcome is a constitutional failure, not a
coverage failure, and it MUST NOT recur in any module that depends on or is
depended on by this one.

Every test added MUST satisfy ALL of the following. Violation of any of them is
a release blocker, irrespective of coverage metrics, CI status, reviewer
sign-off, or schedule pressure.

1. **Same surfaces the user touches.** The test must traverse the production
   code path the user's action triggers, end to end, with no shortcut that
   bypasses real wiring.

2. **Provably falsifiable on real defects.** Before merging, the author MUST
   run the test once with the underlying feature deliberately broken (throw
   inside the function, return the wrong row, return the wrong status) and
   confirm the test fails with a clear assertion message. The PR description
   MUST state which deliberate break was used and what failure the test
   produced. A test that cannot be made to fail by breaking the thing it claims
   to verify is a bluff test by definition.

3. **Primary assertion on user-visible state.** The chief failure signal MUST
   be on something a real consumer could see or measure: rendered output,
   persisted database row, HTTP response body / status / header, file written
   to disk, packet on the wire. "Mock was invoked N times" is a permitted
   secondary assertion, never the primary one.

4. **Integration / Challenge tests are the load-bearing acceptance gate.** A
   green Challenge Test means a real consumer can complete the flow against
   real services — not "the wiring compiles". A feature for which a Challenge
   Test cannot be written is, by definition, not shippable.

5. **CI green is necessary, not sufficient.** Before any release tag is cut, a
   human (or a scripted black-box runner) MUST have exercised the feature
   end-to-end and observed the user-visible outcome.

6. **Inheritance.** This rule applies recursively to every consumer of this
   submodule. Consumer constitutions MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax
   this one.

## Seventh Law inheritance (Anti-Bluff Enforcement, 2026-04-30)

In addition to the Sixth Law above, this submodule inherits Lava's **Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)** when consumed by the Lava project (`vasic-digital/Lava`). The Seventh Law was added to Lava's `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-04-30 to mechanically enforce the Sixth Law: every test commit MUST carry a Bluff-Audit stamp (mutation/observed-failure/reverted protocol); every feature MUST pass a real-stack verification gate; release tags MUST be preceded by a real-device attestation; forbidden test patterns (mocking the SUT, verification-only assertions, ignored tests without follow-up, build-success-as-only-assertion) are pre-push-rejected; a recurring bluff hunt and a bluff discovery protocol apply.

The authoritative verbatim text lives in the parent Lava `CLAUDE.md` under "Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)". This submodule MAY add stricter clauses but MUST NOT relax any of the seven Seventh-Law clauses. Both the submodule's own anti-bluff rules and Lava's Sixth + Seventh Laws are binding when consumed by Lava; the stricter of the two applies.

## Clause 6.L — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate (Operator's Standing Order)

Inherited verbatim from parent Lava `/CLAUDE.md` §6.L. The operator has invoked this mandate **TWENTY-THREE TIMES** across two working days. The 10th invocation (2026-05-05, after Phase 7 readiness was reported, when the operator commissioned the full rebuild-and-test-everything cycle for tag Lava-Android-1.2.3): "Rebuild Go API and client app(s), put new builds into releases dir (with properly updated version codes) and execute all existing tests and Challenges! Any issue that pops up MUST BE properly addressed by addressing the root causes (fixing them) and covering everything with validation and verification tests and Challenges!"

Every test, every Challenge Test, every CI gate added to or maintained in this submodule MUST do exactly one job: confirm the feature it claims to cover actually works for an end user, end-to-end, on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, NEVER sufficient. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre.

Inheritance is recursive. Sub-submodules MAY paste this clause verbatim; they MUST NOT abbreviate or relax it.

## Clause 6.O (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.O — Crashlytics-Resolved Issue Coverage Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.O. Every Crashlytics-recorded issue (fatal OR non-fatal) closed/resolved by any commit MUST gain (a) a validation test in the language of the crashing surface that reproduces the conditions, (b) a Challenge Test under `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/lava/app/challenges/` (client) or `tests/e2e/` (server) that drives the same user-facing path, and (c) a closure log at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/<date>-<slug>.md` recording the issue ID, root-cause analysis, fix commit SHA, and links to the tests. `scripts/tag.sh` MUST refuse release tags whose CHANGELOG mentions Crashlytics fixes without matching closure logs. Marking a Crashlytics issue "closed" in the Console requires the test coverage to land first — never close-mark before the regression-immunity tests exist. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05, 2 Crashlytics-recorded crashes within minutes of the first Firebase-instrumented APK distribution (Lava-Android-1.2.3-1023, commit `e9de508`); post-mortem at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-firebase-init-hardening.md`. The operator's ELEVENTH §6.L invocation made this clause load-bearing.

## Clause 6.P (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.P — Distribution Versioning + Changelog Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.P. Every distribute action (Firebase App Distribution, container registry pushes, releases/ snapshots, scripts/tag.sh) MUST: (1) carry a strictly increasing versionCode (no re-distribution of already-published codes); (2) include a CHANGELOG entry — canonical file `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root + per-version snapshot at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>.md`; (3) inject the changelog into the App Distribution release-notes via `--release-notes`. `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` REFUSES to operate when current versionCode ≤ last-distributed versionCode for the channel, OR when CHANGELOG.md lacks an entry for the current version, OR when the per-version snapshot file is missing. `scripts/tag.sh` enforces the same gates pre-tag. Re-distributing the same versionCode is forbidden across distribute sessions; idempotent retry within a single session is permitted. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:11 operator's TWELFTH §6.L invocation: "when distributing new build it must have version code bigger by at least one then the last version code available for download (already distribited). Every distributed build MUST CONTAIN changelog with the details what it includes compared to previous one we have published!"

## Clause 6.Q (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.Q — Compose Layout Antipattern Guard** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Q. Forbids nesting vertically-scrolling lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyVerticalGrid, LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid) inside parents giving unbounded vertical space (verticalScroll, unbounded wrapContentHeight, LinearLayout-with-weight wrapper). Equivalent rule horizontally for LazyRow / LazyHorizontalGrid / LazyHorizontalStaggeredGrid. Per-feature structural tests + Compose UI Challenge Tests on the §6.I matrix are the load-bearing acceptance gates. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:51 operator-reported "Opening Trackers from Settings crashes the app" — TrackerSelectorList used LazyColumn nested in TrackerSettingsScreen's Column(verticalScroll). Closure log: `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-tracker-settings-nested-scroll.md`. Pattern guard: `feature/tracker_settings/src/test/.../TrackerSelectorListLazyColumnRegressionTest.kt`. The operator THIRTEENTH §6.L invocation triggered this clause.

## §6.R — No-Hardcoding Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.R. No connection address, port, header field name, credential, key, salt, secret, schedule, algorithm parameter, or domain literal shall appear as a string/int constant in tracked source code. Every such value MUST come from `.env` (gitignored), generated config class, runtime env var, or mounted file. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.S — Continuation Document Maintenance Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.S. The file `docs/CONTINUATION.md` (in the parent Lava repo) is the single-file source-of-truth handoff document for resuming work across any CLI session. Every commit that changes phase status, lands a new spec/plan, bumps a submodule pin, ships a release artifact, discovers/resolves a known issue, or implements an operator scope directive MUST update `docs/CONTINUATION.md` in the SAME COMMIT. The §0 "Last updated" line MUST track HEAD. This submodule MAY add stricter rules (e.g., maintain its own CONTINUATION) but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.T — Universal Quality Constraints (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.T. All four sub-points (Reproduction-Before-Fix, Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges, No-Force-Push, Bugfix Documentation) apply verbatim. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax any of §6.T.1–§6.T.4.

## §6.U — No sudo/su Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.U. Every use of `sudo` or `su` is strictly forbidden. Operations requiring elevated privileges MUST use container-based solutions from the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule or be provided by local project/Submodule dependencies that build automatically. The pre-push hook rejects files containing `sudo ` or `su ` patterns. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.V — Container Emulators Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.V. Every Android emulator instance for Challenge Tests / UI verification MUST run inside a container managed by the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule. Rootless Podman/Docker only. All tests execute inside containers. The §6.I matrix (API 28/30/34/latest, phone/tablet/TV) runs inside container-bound emulators. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.W — GitHub + GitLab Only Remotes (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.W. Only GitHub (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) and GitLab (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) are permitted as Git remotes. GitFlic, GitVerse, and all other providers are forbidden. The 4-mirror model is replaced by 2-mirror (GitHub + GitLab). This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.X — Container-Submodule Emulator Wiring Mandate (inherited 2026-05-13, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.X. Every Android emulator instance the project depends on for testing MUST execute its emulator process INSIDE a podman/docker container managed by `Submodules/Containers/`, NOT be host-direct-launched by Containers-submodule code that runs on the host. The Containers submodule's `pkg/runtime/` (rootless podman/docker auto-detection) brings the container up; `pkg/emulator/` orchestrates the AVD lifecycle inside it. Lava-side `scripts/run-emulator-tests.sh` is thin glue forwarding to the Containers CLI. The container-bound path is the gate — host-direct emulators are permitted for workstation iteration only. §6.X-debt tracks the wiring implementation owed to `Submodules/Containers/`. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## Article XI §11.9 — Anti-Bluff Forensic Anchor (cascaded from parent CONSTITUTION.md)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-04-29, reasserted multiple times across 2026-05): *"We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product!"*

Operative rule: **The bar for shipping is not "tests pass" but "users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry positive runtime evidence captured during execution. Metadata-only / configuration-only / absence-of-error / grep-based PASS without runtime evidence are critical defects regardless of how green the summary line looks. No false-success results are tolerable.

This anchor MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md alongside CONST-047 — see the parent repository's `CONSTITUTION.md` for the full text.
